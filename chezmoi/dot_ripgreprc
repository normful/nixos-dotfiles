# SEARCH OPTIONS
# ========================================

# Search case insensitively if the pattern is all lowercase. Otherwise, search case sensitively.
--smart-case

# ========================================
# FILTER OPTIONS
# ========================================

# This flag instructs ripgrep to follow symbolic links while traversing directories.
# This behavior is disabled by default.
# Note that ripgrep will check for symbolic link loops and report errors if it finds one.
# ripgrep will also report errors for broken links.
--follow

# Search hidden files and directories.
# Note that if a hidden file or a directory is whitelisted in an ignore file, then it will be
# searched even if this flag isn't provided.
# Similarly if a hidden file or directory is given explicitly as an argument to ripgrep.
# A file or directory is considered hidden if its base name starts with a dot character (.).
# On operating systems which support a "hidden" file attribute, like Windows, files with this
# attribute are also considered hidden.
--hidden

# Files such as .gitignore, .ignore and .rgignore will not be respected.
--no-ignore


# Include or exclude files and directories for searching that match the given glob.
# This always overrides any other ignore logic. Multiple glob flags may be used.
# Globbing rules match .gitignore globs.
# Precede a glob with a ! to exclude it.
# If multiple globs match a file or directory, the glob given later in the command line takes precedence.
#
# When this flag is set, every file and directory is applied to it to test for a match.
# For example, if you only want to search in a particular directory foo,
# then -g foo is incorrect because foo/bar does not match the glob foo.
# Instead, you should use -g 'foo/**'.

# OUTPUT OPTIONS
# ========================================

--hyperlink-format=default

# Omit lines longer than this limit in bytes.
# Instead of printing long lines, only the number of matches in that line is printed.
--max-columns=150

# Prints a preview for lines exceeding the configured max column limit.
--max-columns-preview

--no-line-number

# Sort by file path.
# Always single-threaded.
# The order is determined by sorting files in each directory entry during traversal.
# This means that given the files a/b and a+, the latter will sort after the former even though + would normally sort before /.
# To sort results in reverse or descending order, use the --sortr flag.  Also, this flag overrides --sortr.
# Note that sorting results currently always forces ripgrep to abandon parallelism and run in a single thread.
# --sort=path

#--colors=line:fg:0xf2,0xc2,0x60
#--colors=match:bg:0x2b,0x83,0xa6

# ========================================
# TYPE ADDITIONS
# ========================================

# Most like you don't need to add any `type-add` flags here because `rg` has many built in already.
# `rg --type-list` shows them all.
